            <h2>About me </h2>
            <p>   Hi, my name is Elizabeth, I currently go to Sprauge highschool. Im in many different classes this year but im excited to keep on learning new things.
           I still im not sure what I want to do in the future but I know with a lot of determination and hardwork I can accomplish my dreams.
               I have many different hobbies / things that are import to me, but I only wrote about the most important ones
            below.

      <h2>Family</h2>
      <p>I have a lot of family in general. Most of my famliy lives in oregon 
      but I have some that live in cailfornia and Mexico. I have a lot of cousins, like about
      32 in total but those are from my dad's side, I have even more in my mom's side. I've 
      gone to see my family that lives in Mexico, it was a fun experience. Since most of my family is here 
      I get to hang out with my cousins a lot because we all live in salem, just different 
      parts of salem.</p>

      <h2>Art!</h2>
     <p> Ever since I can remember I've always loved art, I started when I was 6 years old. And even right now,
     I still love art and I want to continue getting better at it too. I have drawn many things over the years, some good and 
     some bad but I don't give up and I never will. P.S. In Galleries there is a link where I showcase
     my art work ;-; .</p>

        <h2>Bass Guitar</h2>
      <p>Another one of my hobbies is playing an instrument which is the bass guitar which I played for about 8 years.
      I started when I was about 8-7 years old and I was in 3rd grade, my dad used to 
      play bass and he was the one who taught me. I play in church every sundays and some wedsdays. But
      I don't consider myself a super good bass player because there is still 
      a lot of new things to learn but I think I can improve more if I practice a lot.
