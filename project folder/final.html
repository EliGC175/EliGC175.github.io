        <p class="Words">But all hope is not lost just as billy and his 
        dad were about to head to their car the owner stops them.
        <span class="Wait">"Wait!"</span> the owner explained,"I do
        have one last tree...but it's not the greatest. So you can have 
        it free of charge".<br>
        "I'll take it" Billy's dad declared <br>
        On the way home Billy was upset with his Dad for getting that 
        tree,When they got home his Dad asked him why he was upset,Billy 
        Shouted "Why did we have to get this <span class="Ugly"> ugly tree! </span>all my friends
        have a real chirstmas tree why can't we have a regular tree!" <br>
        "Billy...clam down I know your upset but this was the only tree 
        that was left I know it's not that great but at least we have a tree...
        you know when I was little My parents didn't have a lot of money,
         when it was chirstmas I didn't even have a big and pretty tree
        and I only had one present...So you see chirstmas is not just about
        a pretty or big tree or the presents it's about spending time with your
        family" Billy's Dad expressed.<br>
        Billy was flabbergastest he didn't know that his Dad had to live like that
        "I'm so sorry Dad that I yelled at you, you're rigth" Billy said
        his dad accepted his apology. Billy learned an important lesson
        that day, chirstmas is not just about the presents and a pretty tree
        it's about spending time with your friends and family.
